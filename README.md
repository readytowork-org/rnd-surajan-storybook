## How to run it ðŸ¤”?
- First install all the packages using either `npm i`(if you're using npm) or `yarn`(if you're using yarn)
- Then, for running storybook just run `npm run storybook` command.
- For running the entire app just run `npm start` command _(ðŸ’¡ Note: But this repo focuses on storybook more, so you might not see much in the application side)._
